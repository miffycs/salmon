Web app project built with HTML, CSS, React that synthesize id images.\
After inputting name, birth date, sex and image, the app then generates a salmon id card.

## 背景 (Background)
2021年3月，知名連鎖壽司餐廳在台灣發起「若身分證上名字有『鮭魚』二字，可享免費壽司吃到飽」的優惠促銷活動，吸引媒體目光與掀起社群媒體上的大眾討論。此程式是設計為讓使用者能夠參與這場流行的「鮭魚之亂」，不用更改真的身份證也能享受娛樂。
In March 2021, a chained sushi restaurant in Taiwan started a promotion as following: "If you have the exact word 'salmon' on your government ID card, you can receive free sushi all you can eat." This promotion attracted people's attention and became viral on social media. This app was designed for people who wanted to join the trend, without actually changing their names legally on their government ID.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
